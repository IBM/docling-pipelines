"""
Flow Engine Port - Abstract interface for flow execution engines.

This port defines the contract that any flow execution engine must implement,
enabling the orchestrator to work with different execution strategies
(Prefect, Airflow, pure Python, etc.) without tight coupling.

This follows hexagonal architecture principles by defining the port in the
domain layer, allowing adapters to be implemented in the infrastructure layer.
