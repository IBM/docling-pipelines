        - Issues one JobStatsService.list_job_runs(job_ids=flow_ids) call scoped

          This avoids both full-table scans and N+1 per-flow queries.
        - In the standard OSS execution path, JobStats.job_id is set to the flow's
          UUID.  Grouping by run.job_id therefore partitions runs by flow.
        - Runs within each group are sorted by start_time descending; the first
          entry becomes the "latest run" fields on FlowJobRunSummary.
        - Flows absent from the returned dict had no matching runs and will have
          job_run_summary=None in the API response.
        - _MAX_BULK_RUN_FETCH caps the result set.  A warning is logged if the
