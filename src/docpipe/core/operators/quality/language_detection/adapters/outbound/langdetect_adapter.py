    This adapter provides language detection using the langdetect library,

    Features:
        - Fast detection for common languages
        - Probabilistic approach
        - No external dependencies or model downloads
        - Good for general-purpose language detection

    Limitations:
        - Less accurate for short texts
        - Limited to 55 languages
        - May struggle with mixed-language content
