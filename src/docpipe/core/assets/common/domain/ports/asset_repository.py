"""Generic repository interface for all asset types.

This module defines the abstract repository interface that all asset repositories
must implement. It provides a consistent API for BASIC CRUD operations across different
storage backends (local filesystem, DuckDB, CAMS, etc.).

Model-specific repositories can extend this interface to add their own operations
(e.g., bulk_delete for FlowRepository, junction table operations for DocumentLibraryRepository).
