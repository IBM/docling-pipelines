"""Reusable field definitions and constants for Flow API DTOs.

This module provides field definitions, validation patterns, and constraints
used across Flow API DTOs and Job Statistics DTOs.

Module Organization:
--------------------
1. Shared Metadata: Unified patterns and constraints for all DTOs
2. Flow-Specific Patterns: Validation patterns for Flow API
3. Flow-Specific Constraints: Length and array constraints for Flow API
4. Example Values: Realistic examples for documentation
5. JSON Schema Extras: Additional OpenAPI schema constraints
6. Flow Field Descriptions: Human-readable field documentation for Flow API
7. Field Factory Functions: datetime_field() for complex OpenAPI schemas

Architectural Note:
-------------------
All field metadata (patterns, lengths, descriptions) has been consolidated
into this module to simplify the DTO layer while maintaining strict validation.
Core domain models remain decoupled from these API-specific validation rules.

# - datetime_field: Complex json_schema_extra structure for OpenAPI compliance
#
# Why only one factory?
# - Previous factories (name_field, description_field, etc.) were removed
# - They added unnecessary indirection without significant value
# - Direct Field() usage in DTOs is clearer and more maintainable
# - datetime_field remains because its json_schema_extra is complex and reused

    This factory exists because datetime fields require complex json_schema_extra

    Why This Factory Exists:
        - Datetime fields need multiple json_schema_extra properties for OpenAPI
        - Configuration is identical for created_on and modified_on
        - Centralizing prevents duplication and ensures consistency
        - OpenAPI "date-time" format requires specific schema structure
