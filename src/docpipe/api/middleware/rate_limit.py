"""In-process sliding-window rate limiter for authentication endpoints.

Tracks per-IP attempt counts within a sliding time window.

Limitations:
- Single-process only: state is lost on restart and not shared across
  workers/replicas. Replace with a Redis-backed store for multi-instance
  deployments.
- Reverse-proxy deployments: client_ip is derived from the TCP peer address
  (request.client.host). Behind nginx or a k8s Ingress this will be the proxy
  IP, making the limit ineffective for all real clients. Configure your proxy
  to forward X-Forwarded-For and update get_client_ip() to read that header
  when the deployment is behind a trusted reverse proxy.
