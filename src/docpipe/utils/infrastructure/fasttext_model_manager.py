"""
FastText Model Manager with Singleton Pattern and Reference Counting

This module provides a thread-safe singleton manager for the FastText language detection model.
It implements reference counting to efficiently manage model loading/unloading across parallel flows.

Key Features:
- Thread-safe singleton pattern with double-checked locking
- Reference counting for memory-efficient model sharing
- Lock timeout protection (60s for acquire, 10s for release)
- Graceful error handling with error state tracking
- Separate download lock to prevent concurrent downloads
- Automatic SSL fallback for corporate proxy environments

    Thread-safe singleton manager for FastText language detection model.

    Features:
    - Singleton pattern ensures only one model instance per process
    - Reference counting for efficient memory management
    - Automatic model download if not present (with download lock protection)
    - Thread-safe acquire/release operations with configurable timeouts
    - Error state tracking to prevent repeated failed load attempts
    - Graceful degradation when model loading fails

    Thread Safety:
    - Uses separate locks for model operations and downloads
    - Lock timeouts prevent indefinite blocking (60s acquire, 10s release)
    - Double-checked locking pattern for singleton and downloads
